			description = On initial discovery, astronomers found it hard to believe Laythe was a real planet and not just a modified picture of Kerbin. Laythe's tropical demeanor and high tectonic activity are amazing to commoners, and absolutely frightening to planetary scientists. It's far too distant to have any of these things! Jool's presence as a tidal force alone can't be enough to have left Laythe's stove on. \n\nStill, we're not sure what else could compensate for the shivering cold environment Laythe finds itself in. Even more anomalous than its heat signature is the light we are seeing reflecting off of Laythe's night side. Speculation as to what could cause this light ranges from excessive volcanism, worldwide aurora to bioluminescent plankton and everything in between. Maybe Laythe harbors life.

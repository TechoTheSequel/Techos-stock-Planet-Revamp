//Rescale settings
//Options are:

    //Stock     //Stock gameplay. Planet sizes, atmospheres and orbits are exactly identical to stock KSP.
                //1.0x Scale.
                //1.0x Rotation Periods.
                //0.875x Scale atmospheres.
                //Planet terrain scale may seem exagerated due to the small size of the planets.

    //Quarter   //Just over double of stock scale, roughly one quarter of real scale.
                //Best used for building realistic proportioned rockets and historical replicas using stock-balanced rocket parts, such as BDB/Tantares.
                //2.5x Scale for major objects, minor objects will retain stock sizes.
                //1.6x Rotation Periods.
                //0.875x Scale atmospheres, remaining as they are in stock.
                //Planet terrain scale is kept as it is in stock scale, however it should look nicer.

    //Half      //5.0625x scale for major bodies, minor objects and Minmus scaled by 2.5x
                //2.25x rotation periods.
                //0.875x Scale atmospheres, remaining as they are in stock.
                //Planet terrain scale and noise increased to account for larger scale, this may result in planets looking different from the ground compared to space.

    //HalfRealDensitys  //Optional realistic density patch for Half scale
                        //Densitys are brought to realistic values for the size of the objects, Resulting in surface gravitys being lowered.
                        //Based around R-T-B's stock rescale.

    //Real      //10x scale for major bodies, minor objects and Minmus scaled by 2.5x
                //Kerbins orbit has been set to exactly 1 AU
                //3.2x rotation periods, with the exception being Kerbin's rotation period set to be equal to 24 hours.
                //Kerbols mass and radius have been replaced with values from the Sun.
                //Fully redone 1.0x scale atmospheres.
                //Balanced around 365 day years.
                //Planet terrain scale and noise increased to account for larger scale, this may result in planets looking different from the ground compared to space.

    //Options are:

    //Kerbin    //Default option

    //Duna      //Less atmo and less planet make for a interesting challenge!

    //Eve       //Hard mode. Good luck, you will be needing it here.
